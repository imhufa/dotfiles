**TWO DEW!**
=====================
*_the infamous list_*
---------------------



* plan a realistic scalable structure for repo for on-going commits
* create a visual representation of repo in preperation for bigger and better things
* edit current static files to properly represent what this newb repo is actually for
* list necessary static files in preparation for static sites (github.io, readme.md, wiki, etc)
* organize structure of dotfiles database
* ensure necessity of files
* ensure remote db compatibility for ease of access when pull is required on different device or distro
* ...organize the _config_ directory...
* list (and maybe rate) apps from required, to necessary, and nice-to-have
* about me..? nah.. not yet. soonish..? nah.. well maybe.
* hmmm....
<br>
* structure this sentence for the sole purpose of giving the perception that this **_specific_** task to do is really **important** but really it's only here to hopefully let the reader know that he is most probably *reading* but not *ingesting* the text in front of him/her that was written by an average, noob boomer. 
<br>
* ***and this*** is the follow-up to let him/her know, it's ok, me too, all the time. and to ***not worry*** and ***be happy!***
